To avoid divisibility with 100 numbers, we must pick exactly one number for each of the 100 odd parts.\n3. Also, to minimize divisibility chances, we usually pick numbers from the \"top half\" ($101..200$).\n4. However, we are forced to pick a number $x < 16$. Let's say $x=3$ ($m=3$).\n5. If we pick $x=3$, we cannot pick any multiple of 3 (like $6, 9, \\dots$) or any number that 3 divides.\n6. But we MUST pick a number with odd part $m=3$ to have 100 numbers. So we picked $3$.\n7.

The only way to avoid $x$ dividing another number $y$ is if $y$ is not a multiple of $x$. But the pigeonhole structure forces us to pick numbers that eventually collide with the multiples of small $x$.\n"
